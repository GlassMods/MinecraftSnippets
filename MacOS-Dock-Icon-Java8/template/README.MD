# A Recreated Icon Template
### ⚠️ This is not the official template by Apple, if you can use the [offical one](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/).
- Mask = Rounded Rect, 22 corner radius
- Shadow = Mask moved down a few pixels and blured with a 5px radius (black with 32 alpha)
### Please note that the official template uses a squircle not a rounded rect

## How to use
Open the shadow in your [image editing software](https://www.photopea.com) then place your background and logo on top in a group, use the mask on that group (make sure that the mask is centered in the frame correctly) then export it as a png.
